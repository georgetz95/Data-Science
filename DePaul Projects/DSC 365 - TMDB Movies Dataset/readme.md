## Introduction
Our dataset includes variables such as Title, Runtime, Genre, Revenue, Budget, Profit, Director, Actor, Production Company, Awards, Oscar Awards, Season, Year, and Release Date. Key variables for drawing conclusions include revenue, profit, genre, budget, director, actor, and awards. These variables provide insights into financial performance, popular genres, critical acclaim, and potential correlations between creative talents and movie success.

Movies have been a cornerstone of entertainment ever since their introduction in the early 20th century. From early black-and-white films to modern CGI blockbusters, they have evolved through technological advancements and cultural changes while maintaining thematic messages and genres that impart sentiments and emotional experiences to audiences.

In this project, we explore movies through the lens of genre to unveil which genres have the biggest impact in terms of revenue and popularity. We focus on movies released between 2001 and 2015, with the primary dataset provided by Kaggle [The Movie Database (TMDB), 2017]. Additional features were added through TMDBâ€™s API and feature engineering.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The first stage of exploration involved reviewing the main numeric features in the dataset and their distributions. We hypothesized that some features may be correlated, providing valuable insights for further analysis.


### Observations
- **Correlation Analysis:** There is a positive correlation between popularity and revenue (0.65), leading us to explore these metrics further.
- **Distribution by Genre:** Non-uniform distribution of average revenue by genre suggests interesting insights in terms of genre performance.

## Visualizations

### Revenue by Genre, Broadly
A horizontal bar chart shows the average revenue for each genre. In the interactive version, hovering over a bar displays the top-earning movie of that genre.

### Identifying and Examining Seasonal Boosts
We explored how revenue by genre changes throughout the year. Some genres thrive during Spring and Summer, particularly Adventure, Animation, Science Fiction, and Family.

### Correlation between Revenue and Popularity
We examined the correlation between revenue and popularity. Despite moderate correlation overall (0.58), the correlation varies by genre.

## Analysis and Discussion
### Main Results
1. **Animation Genre Performance:** Despite relatively few films, the Animation genre ranks in the top 5 for revenue.
2. **Seasonal Trends:** Adventure, Animation, Family, and Science Fiction genres perform particularly well in Spring and Summer.
3. **Correlation Analysis:** The Animation genre has a strong correlation between revenue and popularity (0.81).

### Further Analysis
Further statistical techniques such as regression analysis and clustering can validate hypotheses generated from visualizations.
