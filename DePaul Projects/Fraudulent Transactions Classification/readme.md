# Predicting Fraudulent Transactions Using Binary Classification Algorithms

**Team Member:** Giorgos Tzimas

## Abstract
Using customersâ€™ transactional dataset, we built two supervised machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to classify each instance as either a fraudulent or non-fraudulent transaction. After comparing the performance of both models on important metrics such as recall and False Positive Rate, we picked Random Forest as the final binary classification model to be used.
