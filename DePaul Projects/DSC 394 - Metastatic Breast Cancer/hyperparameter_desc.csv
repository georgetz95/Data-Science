Hyperparameter,Description
learning_rate,"This parameter scales the contribution of each tree in the ensemble. A smaller learning rate means that more trees are needed to build a model of similar complexity. It's often used to balance the model's accuracy versus its generalization. In your case, 0.05 is a relatively small learning rate, promoting more robust learning but requiring potentially more trees to converge to a good solution."
max_depth,"This limits the maximum depth of each tree. Deeper trees can learn more detailed data specifics, enhancing the model's ability to fit complex patterns, but they also increase the risk of overfitting. A depth of 3 is conservative, aiming to keep the model general enough."
max_features,"Determines the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. If None, then all features are considered each time a split is made, which can lead to more computationally intensive and deeper trees."
min_samples_leaf,"The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. Setting this parameter can help prevent overfitting by ensuring that leaves have more than just a few data points. In your configuration, each leaf must have at least 4 samples."
min_samples_split,The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. A higher number makes the model more conservative because it's less likely to create highly specific splits. Your setting of 5 means each internal node must have at least 5 samples before it can be split.
n_estimators,"This is the number of sequential trees to be modeled. While more trees generally improve the model, they also make your model slower to train. An n_estimators value of 300 is relatively high, potentially providing a more accurate model at the cost of increased computational time."
subsample,"The fraction of samples to be used for fitting each individual base learner. Using a subsample (less than 1.0) introduces more randomness into the model, can lead to lower variance, and can speed up training significantly. 0.8 means 80% of the data is used for each tree, which can help in preventing overfitting by adding more diversity to the trees built during training."
